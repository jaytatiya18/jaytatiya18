### My Recent projects 
Project Title: Breast Cell Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms 
Skills Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKlearn, ML.

The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has malignant or benign. The dataset provides the patients‚Äô information. The dataset is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and it was from a breast cancer study on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data.
